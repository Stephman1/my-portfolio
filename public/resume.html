    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I am an aspiring software engineer with 3 years of experience in data engineering, product management and data analysis that taught me how to visualise data, build data pipelines and deliver business insights. Since completing my Masters in Computer and Information Technology in August 2024, I have gained valuable experience in software design, data structures, Java, databases, Python, cyber security, web technologies, networks and C/C++. I am seeking to combine my computer science education with my previous data and research experience and join a software engineering team.</p>
